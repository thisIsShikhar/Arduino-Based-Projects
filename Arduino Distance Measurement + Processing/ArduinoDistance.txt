Description: 

This project is about measuring distance with the help of HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor and Arduino Uno.The HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor uses sonar to determine distance to an object like bats or dolphins do. It offers excellent range accuracy and stable readings in an easy-to-use package having the ranging distance 2cm â€“ 500 cm/1" - 16ft. It operation is not affected by sunlight or black material like Sharp rangefinders are (although acoustically soft materials like cloth can be difficult to detect).Through connecting the pins with pre-programed arduino pins, it is possible to measure the distance of an object in almost accurate value.
